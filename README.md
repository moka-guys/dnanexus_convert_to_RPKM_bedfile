# dnanexus_RPKM_bedfile - v1.0

## What does this app do?
This app takes a bedfile generated by mokabed and creates a bedfile suitable for use with the DNA nexus RPKM app.

## What data are required for this app to run?
The app has two inputs:

1. BED file
This app requires the PanXdata.bed bedfile generated by Mokabed.
  * This file will have two header lines starting with #. These lines are removed by the app
  * The chromosome numbers in the bedfile should not include 'chr' eg 1 NOT Chr1

2. Any additional bed files to concatenate to the BED file (optional)
Common use case is the CNV control sites.
 * These can be found in 001_ToolsReferenceData:Data/BED/
 * These files must have no headers and a blank line at the end of the file.


## What does this app output?
This app produces two outputs:

1. PanX_RPKM.bed
This bed file can be used by the RPKM app

2. PanX_LogFile.txt
Contains all the commands and instructions used to create this bed file.


## Limitations of the App
The control sites must be in 001_ToolsReferenceData:Data/BED/

These files must be in the format :

* chromosome start stop name
* with no headers 
* 'chr' not present
* a blank line at the end of the file

## Created by
